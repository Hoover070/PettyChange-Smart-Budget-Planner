# PettyChange: AI Powered Financial Planner

Welcome to the "PettyChange" repository, the core project for my Project and Portfolio 4 at Full Sail University. This project, developed by William Hoover, aims to revolutionize financial planning with AI-driven insights.

Project Aim:

The goal of PettyChange is to build a smart financial planner capable of predicting an individual's saving potential and providing early warnings if their financial goals are not feasible. This is achieved through the integration of the BudgetApp_Model.

Technologies and Frameworks:

    Maui for cross-platform UI/UX design
    C# for backend logic
    Python for AI model integration
    XAML for detailed UI components
    ONNX Runtime for model deployment

Features:

    Predictive Saving Analysis: AI model forecasts and suggests feasible saving plans.
    User-Friendly Interface: Developed using Maui, offering a seamless experience across devices.
    Customizable Budget Tracking: Allows users to input and track their income and expenses.
    Real-Time Financial Insights: Offers instant feedback and recommendations.

Getting Started:
